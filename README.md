> Phase 1
- User can visit homepage ✅
- User can login / logout to the system ✅
- User can only see their own profile information after successfully logging in ✅
- User can edit profile and keep data in database ✅

> Phase 2
- User can view all their transactions for the current month
- User can view details of a transaction from another view
- User can add, modify, delete information about a transaction

> Specification describing the APIs for transactions according to swagger YAML guidelines
- The HTTP method (ex: GET, POST, etc..)
- The route (ex: /store/inventory)
- The description of what the endpoint corresponds to (ex: Return of the inventory of pets)
- Possible settings to accommodate different scenarios
- The different responses with the corresponding response codes that make sense for this endpoint (ex: 404: unknown article error response)
